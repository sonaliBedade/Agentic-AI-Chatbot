# ðŸ¤– Agentic AI Chatbot

Welcome to Agentic AI Chatbot! It's lightweight chatbot framework built with LangGraph and Streamlit, designed to explore the basics of agentic workflows and LLM routing graphs.

##  What is this project?

This chatbot was built to demonstrate how **graph-based agent execution** can be integrated with modern LLMs to create controlled message routing and basic interaction logic.

You can choose which model to use, and interact with the chatbot through a clean Streamlit interface. Under the hood, the system builds a minimal graph structure to send your input to the selected model and return a response.

##  Key Features

-  **Agentic Graph Routing**: Uses LangGraph to organize LLM calls via a simple graph node structure
-  **Model Selection**: Easily switch between Groq and OpenAI models from the sidebar
-  **Streamlit UI**: Simple and responsive interface for real-time chat with your selected model
-  **Clean Starter Template**: Modular structure makes it easy to extend later

---

##  Use Case

This chatbot is currently designed as a **basic conversational bot** using LLMs. It allows users to:

- Select a model 
- Enter a message in the chat interface
- Get a direct LLM-generated response

This serves as a foundation for more advanced agentic or multi-step workflows, but at this stage it is focused on a **single-message, single-response loop** to keep things lightweight and easy to understand.
